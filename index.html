        <p>Alex has been missing since April 4th, 2025. Her family is urgently searching for any information that could
          help locate her. Even the smallest detail could make a difference. Alex is a Journalism major at the
          University of Central Florida and an active member of multiple campus organizations. Current known details are
          that she was last seen on campus around 6pm and last online the day she went missing. She spoke to her
          roommate that evening before leaving.

          Below are links to Alex’s primarily-used social media as well as that of her friends who are coordinating to
          find her. We are looking for any information that would be helpful in finding them. Emergency Services have
          already been contacted and are unable to lend assistance.
